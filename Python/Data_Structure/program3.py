# Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element
#  in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.
# Sample: [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
# Result: [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]

list1 = [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]

#sorting as per secong element
list1.sort(key = lambda x:x[1])
print(list1)
